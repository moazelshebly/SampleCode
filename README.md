# SampleCode

This is a part of X-Ray simulation project developed to simulate real life X-Rays in order to make dosage adjustments and
simulate approximated X-Ray images to avoid exposing patients and medical staff to high radiations and X-Ray dosages.

This is not a completed project. This was only put in a public repo as a sample code for job applications.
